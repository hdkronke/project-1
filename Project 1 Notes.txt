I am focusing on question #9
If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?

Question IDs worth noting
	1 - age of employee
	2 - gender of employee
	33 - do you currently have a mental health disorder
	48 - if you have a disorder, how often does it interfere with your work (while being treated)?
	49 - if you have a disorder, how often does it interfere with your work (when not treated/experiencing symptoms)?
	54 - do you believe your productivity is ever affected by disorder?
	55 - if work is affected by disorder, what percentage of work time is changed?
	89 - race of employee
	92 - if you have disorder, do you feel it interferes with your work?
	118 - work remote


if question id 54 is blank, use data from 92 and vice versa?
